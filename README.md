# spy_distribution_project


This project is based around the s&p 500 stock index. The dataset csv file contains the top 500 largest companies in the 
index and financial details about them. 

## Purpose

The objectives for me in the app.py folder were: 
1. to show the entire csv file dataset on the web

All the charts were imported from the eda_py file which is a .py version of the jupyter file within the notebooks file. 
I imported variables from the eda_py file into app.py for better readability. 


## Conclusion: 
In concluding our analysis of the S&P 500, we focused on two key aspects: market capitalization and industry distribution. Our findings reveal a diverse yet distinct pattern in the market capitalization of these companies, highlighting the range of large to mega-cap companies that dominate the index. This diversity in market cap underscores the varied nature of companies that collectively drive a significant portion of the U.S. economy.
