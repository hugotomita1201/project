# spy_distribution_project
sprint 4 project

This project is based around the s&p 500 stock index. The dataset csv file contains the top 500 largest companies in the 
index and financial details about them. 

The objectives for me in the app.py folder were: 
1. to show the entire csv file dataset on the web
2. to show the distribution of s&p 500 stocks based on the sector
3. to show a scatter plot of all stocks based on market cap 
4. to have 2 checkboxes and if clicked to show scatter plots below 50 billion and 100 billion


All the charts were imported from the eda_py file which is a .py version of the jupyter file within the notebooks file. 
I imported variables from the eda_py file into app.py for better readability.
