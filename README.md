# spy_distribution_project


This project is based around the s&p 500 stock index. The dataset csv file contains the top 500 largest companies in the 
index and financial details about them. 

## Purpose

The objectives for me in the app.py folder were: 
1. to show the entire csv file dataset on the web

All the charts were imported from the eda_py file which is a .py version of the jupyter file within the notebooks file. 
I imported variables from the eda_py file into app.py for better readability.
